# What is the Temedica?

It is a medicine search tool that I created to show my sample code and demo my coding skills and beacuse of that I avoided to use external libraries as mush as possible intentialy.

# Temedica docker compose

This compose file has been created to compose the back-end and front-end of Temedica docker images.
If you want to run the projects manually, you can skip this step and flow the instructions that have been written for running each project.
### Run the Front-end and Back-end using docker compose

```bash
docker-compose up
```
Front-end server will be started in `http:localhost:5000`

Back-end server will be started in `http:localhost:3005`


## Directories

### Server `./express-server`
### Front-end `./temedica`
